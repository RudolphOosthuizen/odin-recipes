        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>It may not look fancy, but this shipwreck casserole is delicious, kid-approved, and ideal for hectic evenings. Prep is as easy as opening a few cans and unwrapping the meat, and it all comes together in one pot.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (7.25 ounce) package macaroni and cheese mix</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat, breaking it up as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Stir in the macaroni-and-cheese pasta and cheese packet, tomatoes, milk, peas, and corn. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the pasta is tender, about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with seasoned salt, stir in half of the Cheddar cheese until melted, then sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.</li>
        </ol>
